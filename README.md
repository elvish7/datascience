>level 1 : flow chart  
>resource : [draw io](https://www.playpcesor.com/2015/02/drawio.html)  

### week2 2/28 no class
* work on HW0  
>[TA's code](https://github.com/MiccWan/Political-News-Analysis)  

### week3 3/7 Finance CRM case introduction/91APP Customer Behavior Analysis   
* work on HW1(find a theme)  
* learn python model of visualization(matplotlib,seaborn,panda...)  
* Practice - analysis credit card data  

### week4 3/14 Data Comprehension  
* data -> information  
* "Idea" is more importent than technique  
* How to deal with data - visualize, sort out and ask question(to answer)   
* HW1  
>pick a data set, define question and solution    
>data set: ETF data(by Nomura)/select technology ETF only  
>schedule: crawling, visualization(no for loop yet, also there's only 1 ETF data)  

### week5 3/21 Numerical Data Preprocessing    
* R shiny(package) - code output website  
* decide project theme    
* discuss with bank manager about ETF data  

* HW2  
>data preprocessing    

### week6 3/28 Data Visualization/EDA  
* data analysis - deal with dirty data/ask questions and tell stories/decide selected data/build model    

* HW3  
>data visualization/EDA/interpretation    

### week7 4/4 no class    

### week8 4/11 Cluster Analysis    
* machine learning  
* data analysis - how to use data /data mining - basic infrastructure(engineer is like the workers who buld highway)  
* as long as hardware is set up, the key is to apply   
* machine learning is unlike statistic(statistic has assumptions to surmise probability, yet machine learnig is the way to "guess answer")    
* SVM - 2D -> 3D(it's easy to plot, yet hard to come up with the formula)   
>2 input to 3, get the conclution in high dimension, seperate 2 variable, and convert back to 2D   
* deep learning - no need for difficult math, no theory, just "guess answer" and training, find the best solution  

* HW4  
>cluster analysis and find the features    

### week9 4/18 Text Mining(Financial/Medical/Politics)  
* NER、 co-occurrence  
* HW5  
>text data preprocessing    

### week10 4/25 Data Defination & Analysis    
* HW6  
>NER label text key words automatic    

### week11 5/2 Text Correlation    
* relational analysis(could get causal relation) vs co-occurrence(only find things show up together)  
* usually: co-occurrence(find high frequency) -> relational analysis    
* algorithm-Apriori  
* HW7  
>text notation &　group/co-occurrence & relational analysis/visualization   

### week12 5/9 Algorithm(machine learning)      

### week13 5/16 Final Project Pitch   

### week14 5/23 Deep Learning Cases/Algorithm

### week15 5/30 Data Science Lecture   
> Fintech - not only automatic, but creat value of data    
> people should make decision instead of follow the rules    

### week16 6/6 Discussion   

### week17 Final Demo
