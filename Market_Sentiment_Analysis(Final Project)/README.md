# ETF data - Market Sentiment Analysis
In our the final project, we continue the study in ETF_Analysis.ipynb but focus on the market sentiment analysis. The goal is to  find out the relationship between ETF price and market sentiment, and build a model that could predict ETF price.  

## Hypothesis  
* The price has a positive correlation with news sentiment score and popularity online.  
* There is some relationship between ETF price and quality  
* Different industry will react differently when facing the same event, so as the related ETF price reaction and fluctuation to news.
